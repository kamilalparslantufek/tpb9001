This is an example for using instagram graph API's media publishing feature. Works as a node.js worker, with CRON Scheduling.
Also has Firebase Realtime Database REST Calls implemented on as a module.

    * Anime and comic illustration and fanart sharing page, made and hosted on heroku and foreseen by me.
    * This bot is made on python/flask, however i am not going to share implementation of same thing on two different languages. 
    * As a feature this bot scrapes images from specific websites and scrapes instagram hashtags and saves them on Firebase Realtime Database.
    * Also uses Firebase REST calls to get data.
